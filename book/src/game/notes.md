# General Game Idea and Notes

## Map Size and Unit Size
- The size of continental France = ~550,000km<sup>2</sup>
- The dimensions in tiles @ 1 km a tile = ~742<sup>2</sup>

A case study on German armies on the western front, 1914.

## Map Modes
- Literally each part of this nation map should be emulated to some degree
![img.png](reference.png)
- More free control over where certain resources are located.

## Characters
- This applies to your politics, your officers, your researchers, and any other characters in the game
- Type of characters
  - Army Officers
  - Politicians
  - Scientists

- Each character has a set of features
  - Personalities -> Informs their decision-making / decision-making of larger groups (fixed) 
  - Politics -> Their beliefs and alignments (more fluid)
  - Skills -> Based on type of character 
- There's a general manpower pool of 'non critical' people that back them up via numbers
  - Think pops in Vic2/3 with interest groups

## Research
- You hire a swarm of scientists, and they have similar mechanics to officers (personalities, politics, skills, etc.) in the sense they're characters
